## 📚 Context/Description Behind The Change
<!--
  What changes have you made to the code, and why?

  As skilled engineers, we all know how to read and interpret code, so take this opportunity
  to be a bit more verbal about your changes.

  Giving the context behind your changes will make your PR review quicker,
  as the reviewer will not need to guess your intent.
-->

## 🚨 Potential Risks & What To Monitor After Deployment
<!--
  What can go wrong with this deploy?
  Does it touch any critical services?
  How will these changes affect adjacent code/features?
  How will we handle any adverse issues?
-->

## 🧑‍🔬 How Has This Been Tested?
<!--
  Imagine: How do I (and the Reviewer):
  How do we know this PR does what it's supposed to do?
  How do we ensure that adjacent code/features are still working?
  How do we evaluate the performance implications of this PR?
-->

## 🚚 Release Plan
<!--
  Imagine: If you had to leave in a rush, what should the backup engineer do to deploy this?

  Add any tasks that need to be done before/during/after release (i.e, creating indices, deploying
  other services, bumping modules, notifying PM or other engineers, etc).

  ## 🤝 Expectations

  When Opening/Reviewing a PR, please keep in mind:

  ### As the PR Author
  - Provide all the necessary context on "Why" you have performed your changes
  - Assume that the reviewer has no previous knowledge about the codebase: would he/she be able to
    review it the way it is right now?
  - If changes are extensive, break them into smaller commits that tell a story, instead of 1 commit
    with 15 files changed.
  - Split Refactors and New-Code-Changes into different commits, ideally: different PRs.
  - Test your code before requesting review — unless some rare exceptions, we shouldn't ship any code
    without testing it before.
  - If your PR is UI related, consider adding screenshots/videos with the behavior and before/after.

  ### As the PR Reviewer
  - Be kind. Don't nitpick.
  - Expect to have all the necessary context to review the PR on (or linked on) the PR itself.
  - When in doubt: ask.
  - Validate if the author's tests have any missing coverage points. Do not approve an untested PR.
  - Pay extra attention to the "Potential Risks" and "Release Plan" sections.
  - If the PR alters the product UI, consider checking out the branch to visually inspect it.
